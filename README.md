# Pagination
Pagination is the way of displaying the datas to the users with order of pages. We can normally just show the datas to the users line by line continuously like social media posts. But Sometime the data that showing to the users should be organised. At that point pagination method will br helpfull. 

In Pagination method, we show the particular number of data page by pages like google search results. Google search showing results around 10 results per page. If we want go further we can just turn the pages by click the buttons which is linked to the other pages. These type of arrangement of datas called as Pagination.
